I am probably closer to Libertarian than Democrat on many issues, Paul Hammel.

That is why I am so motivated to get Trump out of office. We have never had a President who has posed such a threat to our civil liberties and the basic tenets of our democracy.

He is limiting accountability.

He is limiting transparency. This is in relation to $500,000,000,000 of taxpayer money. We still don't know where that money went.

He attempts to undermine our right to vote, and the legitimacy of the election.

He has alienated our traditional allies.

He has raised the federal deficit.

He has greatly expanded a federal police force, using fear and misinformation.

He ignores Constitutional checks and balances, flouting both Congress and the SCOTUS.

### Put all of that on your scale. Trump does not support personal liberty, and he is strengthening the power of the federal government more than any president in modern history (at least since FDR). ###

I'm fine with being more anti-Trump than pro-Biden. Unfortunately, that's what this election is about. I'd vote for a carrot if it meant increasing the chances Trump was removed from office.

This really isn't about partisan politics for me. This is about ensuring that we stick with the vision of the Founding Father when it comes to the very basic systems of government. As long as we protect that, we can continue to have healthy political debates moving forward.
