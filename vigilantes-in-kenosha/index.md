As patriots, we need to take a stand against injustice within our borders and attacks carried out against our citizens.

If you support responsible law enforcement, I'm with you.

I believe MANY COPS ARE TRYING TO PROTECT AND SERVE THEIR COMMUNITY, but blindly supporting "Back the Blue", and staying silent on corruption, negligence, and abuses of power, is shameful and anti-American.

Jacob Blake was shot in the back 7 times, in front of his children, after breaking up a fight.

A right-wing militia drove in from Illinois to confront the protesters who were demanding accountability. The police THANKED the armed vigilantes and offered them water.

Later that night, one of these agitators, a 17-year old illegally open-carrying a firearm, was standing on the front lines, instigating violence. He shot three people and two of them died.

The killer walked directly past the police following the shootings and THEY DID NOTHING.

We must come together, speak out against vigilante justice, and stand up for the Constitution and the rule of law.

This is not a new issue. Tamir Rice, a 12 year old boy who was playing with a toy gun in a public park, was shot within two seconds of police involvement.

The officer served no time.

There are countless other examples.

If you are silent, you are complicit. We must stand up for what is right, and honor those whose lives have been lost.
