If you read this post, and you still don't think we need meaningful police reform, please reply for a deeper conversation. Under the circumstances, I think that's a fair request.

Jacob Blake was shot in the back 7 times, in front of his children, after breaking up a fight.

The Kenosha killer received supplies and support from the police.

The underage child, openly and illegally carrying a firearm, was told where to go.

He began instigating violence and picking fights. He shot three people and two of them died.

The timeline is well documented and indicates some amount of coordination between the police and a vigilante militia.

Take a moment and think about the gravity of this incident, how much it illustrates the problems we face in this country, and the motivations behind these protests in the first place.

If you think this is acceptable, and systemic racism doesn't exist... I don't even care if I know you. Please jump in and explain yourself.

There are countless other examples of police involvement in unjustified shootings, with the attackers not serving any time.

If you are silent, you are complicit. We must stand up for what is right, and honor those whose lives have been lost.
